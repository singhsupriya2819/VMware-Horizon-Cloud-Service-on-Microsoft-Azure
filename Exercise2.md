# **Exercise 2: Creating an Image**

**About Image Creation**

Microsoft provides a variety of VM templates in the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. Upon import, Horizon Cloud Service joins the VM to the domain, enables the RDS role, automates the Horizon and DaaS installations, and performs a bootstrap process, enabling secure pairing of the DaaS agent to the Horizon Cloud Service pod. All of this is automated, although the process can be performed manually if you want to convert an existing VM to a Horizon Cloud Service image yourself.

After the imported VM is configured with the necessary applications, Horizon Cloud Service converts the VM to an image by automatically running SYSPREP and sealing the OS. You can then use the image to create RDS session host farms and assign dedicated and floating VDI desktops.

**Note:** With the March 2020 release of Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure, you have access to new operating system types in your drop-down menu. For more information, see [_Horizon Cloud on Microsoft Azure Support for Azure Virtual Desktop is Here](https://blogs.vmware.com/euc/2020/03/windows-virtual-desktop-support.html) and [_VMware Horizon Cloud Service Release Notes - v3 - March 2020_](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon-Cloud-Service/services/rn/horizon-cloud-service-relnotes-30.html).


## **Exercise 2.1: Importing VMs from Microsoft Azure Marketplace**

In this exercise, you import a VM from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace, configure it with applications, and convert the VM to an image. With this image, you can then create new instances of the VM.

Later in this Tutorial, a set of exercises create an RDS server farm, for which you need an image with a server OS. Another set of exercises create a pool of VDI desktops, for which you need a Windows 10 desktop OS.

This exercise demonstrates deploying a new image using a desktop OS, and the process for deploying a server OS is virtually the same.
